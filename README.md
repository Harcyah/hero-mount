# hero-mount

A world of warcraft addon, which adds a `/heromount` command, which casts a different mount based on player location.

- Under level 20 : driver mount
- Swimming underwater : aquatic mount
- Flyable area : flying mount
- Somewhere else : ground mount

TODO:

- Make mounts configurable
- Add more special zones
